# Spice-like-program

Development of a circuit simulation program like SPICE in C using GSL library to conduct static, 
transient and frequency Analysis. The circuit is given with a Netlist and then equations and differential systems 
of linear and nonlinear circuits are formatted and solved. 
Sparse matrix algorithms for the simulation of large-scale circuits are also used.
